# Note to Code Shelter maintainers

I took over this project in 2018 to get it back on its feet becasue the original
developer abandoned it, and time had rendered it inoperable. It has since come to be
used by a large number of people who needed Firebase access in their Python projects.
I don't have as much time as I'd like to dedicate to this project these days, 
and I'd appreciate some help with maintaining it. I will generally be available 
to consult and maybe develop the occasional bugfix, but beyond that you're on your own.

It would be great if you could help out with issue triage, fixing bugs and
occasionally developing new features that you think are necessary. The project
is mainly feature-complete, and stable, so I don't expect any major redevelopment.
I would appreciate being consulted before making any drastic changes, but other than
that, you have free reign.

I have already added Code Shelter to the project's PyPI page, so feel free to
make any releases necessary.

Thanks,

Nick
